1. Convert everything to 784, 128, 10 so that we just have one
   hidden layer. Does not matter the accuracy, just that we have this.
2. Check out how they map to 32x32 because it might be just what we do?
    - It is already what we have :)
    - Need to include bias into our models :)
3. Write training scripts for 784,128,10 and conversions to the binary
   weights. (I am not quite sure how to do this, but we should do it anyways)
4. Run IMAC-Sim for 10k image set :) and augment to get energy data
5. Write scripts to get 32x32 and everything working for LASANA
6. Run on LASANA, but I think we will just model the neuron in 
   python? 
7. Compare accuracy and energy :)
