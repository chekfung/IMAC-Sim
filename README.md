# IMAC-Sim
IMAC-Sim is a Python-based simulation framework, which creates the SPICE netlist of the In-Memory Analog Computing (IMAC) circuit based on various device- and circuit-level hyperparameters selected by the user, and automatically evaluates the accuracy, power consumption and latency of the developed circuit using a user-specified dataset.
